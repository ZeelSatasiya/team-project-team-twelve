# XP Core Values Implemented

1. Simplicity

- We evaluated every feature that needed to be added to the program and made the decision to choose the most straightforward yet effective tools and technologies.
- It was important to keep the program straightforward so that people could easily utilize it.

2. Courage

- Every single one of us had the courage to speak up whenever we encountered problems or felt that something wasn't right with the team.

3. Respect

- When working on a cooperative project, one of the most crucial things is to respect the opinions of your teammates.
- We tried to put everyone's suggestions into practice while respecting each person's choice. When some ideas weren't acceptable, we had the guts to calmly explain why to them.
